Just a little raspberry pi project I built to monitor some stats at an old carwash, primarily for the owner to monitor when one of his high pressure pumps would need maintenance.

It's really not intended to be used by anyone, I'm just using github for easy hosting.

Poorly written because it was just a quick throw-it-together type of project... but hey, it's still running 3 years later!
